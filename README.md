# Job queue application

- Task: Implement a javascript frontend and python backend to process images to text.
- Position: Learning and Development Devops Automation Engineer

## Constraints

---

- You have to complete the task independently
- The frontend should be implemented in React preferably, but other modern frameworks are accceptable.
- The backend should be implemented in Python
- You must use a Git repository and commit frequently
- There is no time limit for this assignment
- Each separate part (Frontend/Backend) must be in their own docker container

## Evaluation

---

- We expect the application to handle multiple incoming job requests.
- The primary goal of this exercise is to see how you handle the connection and communication between multiple systems.
- The code you deliver will be evaluated and we will be doing a review with you.

## Main Tasks

---

- Implement a frontend that allows a user to upload images for processing.
- The frontend should give an overview of jobs in progress.
- Implement a backend that can accept these images and pass them to the ImageProcess module.
